# Prework Study Guide

## Description

The "Prework Study Guide" is a comprehensive webpage designed to house study notes on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git for the upcoming bootcamp class at UofT SCS. The inspiration for this project stemmed from a need for easy and convenient access to notes during the intense study sessions of the bootcamp. But why limit this utility to one person? The project was extended to benefit other students who might want to compare notes or gain new insights.

A distinctive aspect of this project lies in its incorporation of a random number generator within the console. When Chrome DevTools is opened, it triggers the generator, presenting the user with a study topic suggestion, thus answering the frequent question, "What should I study first?" This feature enhances the usability of the guide, transforming it into a dynamic study partner rather than a static collection of notes.

Throughout the creation of the Prework Study Guide, significant strides were made in learning and applying HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript, showcasing a significant personal learning curve.

## Installation

N/A

No specific installation steps are required as this project is hosted on a webpage.

## Usage

Using the Prework Study Guide is as simple as browsing a webpage. Each page section contains detailed notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

To activate the unique study suggestion feature, open Chrome DevTools. For macOS, press Command+Option+I and Windows, use Control+Shift+I. This action opens a console panel, either below or to the side of the webpage in your browser. The console will display a list of topics covered during prework and generate a suggestion on which topic to focus on next.

This dynamic approach to studying helps break the monotony of studying and ensures a well-rounded understanding of all subjects.
